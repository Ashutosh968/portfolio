# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project was built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for building your own portfolio.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh968/portfolio.git

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath
   react-parallax-tilt react-vertical-timeline-component @emailjs/browser
   framer-motion react-router-dom
   
   npm install -D tailwindcss
   npx tailwindcss init -p

## Usage

Once you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can start the development server and make changes to the portfolio as needed.

  ```bash
  npm run dev
```

This will launch the development server, and you can access your portfolio website in your browser at http://localhost:5173.

## Customize
To customize the portfolio to reflect your own information, projects, and experiences, you can modify the source code and content files. Here are some key directories and files to consider:

src/components: Contains React components for various sections of the portfolio.
src/data: Update the JSON files in this directory to include your own information.
src/assets: Store your images, icons, and other assets here.
Feel free to make design and layout changes using Tailwind CSS classes, and add or remove sections as needed.

## Build and Deploy
When you are satisfied with your portfolio and ready to deploy it, you can build the project using the following command:

  ``` bash
  npm run build
  ```

This will generate an optimized production build in the dist directory, which you can then deploy to a web hosting service of your choice.
